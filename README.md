# Pneumonia-Detection

This repository contains an implementation of Pneumonia Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained to classify chest X-ray images as either showing signs of pneumonia or being normal. The project aims to assist in the automated detection of pneumonia, which can aid in early diagnosis and treatment.
